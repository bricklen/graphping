### What is Graphping?
Graphping is a simple tool to output of the ping command in an ascii-text line graph on the command line, courtesy of blessed-contrib.

* The Help menu can be invoked via "node graphping -h".
* Basic usage: "node graphping", which will ping google.ca every second.
* Extended usage: "node graphping google.com -y 2500", where "google.com" is the site to ping, and "-y 2500" is the maximum data point in milliseconds to show on the graph.
* To exit the graph, Use any of the following: "q", Escape key, or Ctrl+c.
